          </div>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            Megan was born in Staten Island, New York to parents who were
            already dedicated social activists. Megan’s father, Van, was a
            committed advocate of civil rights reform and traveled from New York
            to Virginia in 1965 and 1966 to participate in civil rights support
            and voter registration in marginalized communities.
          </p>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            Van was also a long-time member of the War Resistors League, an
            organization dedicated to nuclear non-proliferation and the practice
            of non-violent protest in support of social justice. After
            graduating from law school, Van’s career included legal work with
            the Criminal Justice Coalition (an anti-death penalty lobby), the
            Counsel for the Commission of Corrections for New York state, and as
            a public defender until his retirement.
          </p>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            Megan’s mother, Janet, has always been a staunch supporter of the
            rights of women and members of the LGTBQ community. Early in Megan’s
            life, as co-chair of the Staten Island Fair Housing Committee, Janet
            would attend and participate in the organization of community
            events. Along with supporting fair housing initiatives, Janet worked
            for women’s rights, early childhood education, and local food banks.
          </p>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            In 1974 Megan and her parents moved to NJ to live in a commune they
            co-founded, called Cedarcroft. It was “an experiment in non-violent
            living” where the ideals of non-violent social action were
            discussed, taught and modeled. Unlike what many think of as a
            commune, the inhabitants of this one did not isolate; instead they
            took these ideas to their community through being active members: a
            lawyer, a mechanic, a teacher, a newspaper editor and a
            photographer. While Megan’s father continued his peace activism, her
            mother became more and more involved in the Woman’s Movement
            co-organizing and hosting the 1978 Sussex County, New Jersey First
            Women’s Weekend attended by 100s of women for all over the country.
          </p>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            After moving to Saratoga Springs, NY, Megan’s mother continued to
            take her to events such as the Equal Rights Amendment marches of the
            1980s in Saratoga, where 30 years later, Megan and Janet (along with
            Janet’s wife, Linda) would march in the streets of Saratoga again in
            support of equal rights for women. Janet’s career road lead her to
            elementary education where she spent over 30 years working in
            classrooms of economically underserved neighborhoods in Troy, NY.
          </p>
          <p class="about-one__text">
            Megan’s involvement in community justice and civil rights started
            with her parents and continued through her choices in her own
            education, career, and community engagement.
          </p>
          <div class="block-title">

          </div>
          <p class="about-one__text m-0">
            Megan came to Norfolk, Virginia to attend college where she
            graduated magna cum laude from Old Dominion University in 1991 with
            a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice. During her undergraduate
            work, Megan was awarded outstanding criminal justice student for
            1990-1991 and was also a member of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society.
            Additionally, Megan externed at the H.E.R. Shelter for Battered
            Women in Portsmouth, Virginia where she was hired as the Special
            Project Coordinator after graduation. A year after graduation, Megan
            started at Albany Law School in Albany, New York. During law school
            she was a founding member of the school's Domestic Violence Clinic
            at Albany Law School. Megan’s third year of law school was completed
            at the University of Richmond where she was a staff member of the
            Virginia Supreme Court’s Commission on Family Violence Prevention.
          </p>
          <div class="block-title">
            <p class="mt-5 text-center block-title__tag-line">Career</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As a career prosecutor, Megan has served on the juvenile team, drug team, violent  crime team, and general prosecution teams of both Virginia Beach and Norfolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Offices, as well as serving as the deputy of the juvenile team and special crimes team in Norfolk. In 2012 Megan moved to the Gloucester County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office where she took over as the Chief Deputy of that office. Megan has successfully prosecuted cases at every level of seriousness including both high-profile cases and cases of importance only to those involved.  Of special interest to her are the crimes committed against our children. Of her many child abuse cases, one involved a 4-year-old who was starved to death and another involved a child who was kept in a cage for 5 years.  Both cases ended in Megan successfully prosecuting multiple defendants who all received significant prison sentences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Megan takes very seriously the purposes of juvenile court and treats each case on an individual basis, often working with Court Services, defense attorneys, and the guardian ad litem to reach an appropriate disposition that balances the demands of justice, the needs of the juvenile, and the wishes of the victims. Megan is a multidisciplinary team facilitator where she collaborates with multiple stakeholder agencies and also participates in a regional task force on elder abuse. Megan is also a mentor and teacher to countless new prosecutors believing in the importance of fostering talents to better serve the community. She is very proud of the fact that several legal interns who planned on being defense attorneys after law school, changed their career path to that of prosecution after working with her. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During the past few years Megan has also made her personal experiences with vicarious trauma public to educate others and to reassure many that they are not alone. Part of this effort has involved teaching about vicarious trauma to prosecutors, law enforcement and DSS workers, publishing an article in the University of Richmond’s Law School Public Interest Law Review, and adding it to the Commonwealth Attorney’s Services Council Trial Advocacy program. Megan is also recognized as a Mental Health Expert in the Virginia Supreme Court’s Report of Wellness.  Most recently, in 2020, Megan was awarded the Virginia S. Duval Distinguished JDR Prosecutor Award in recognition of outstanding service in juvenile and domestic relations district court.

          </div>
          <p>
            Megan’s history of public service and community engagement are what motivate her to carry on the early lessons learned from her family.  Always looking for ways to give back to the citizens of Norfolk, Megan has volunteered for multiple organizations dedicated to community improvement.  In particular, REACH, Inc (Reading Enriches All Children) and Teens With a Purpose are two causes close to Megan’s heart.  Beginning in  2007, Megan volunteered as a shelter reader for REACH, an organization focused on childhood literacy, especially in underserved communities. She eventually became a Board member, later becoming Board Secretary, then Board President. She remains on the Board today.  Since 2018, Megan as volunteered for Teens with a Purpose and serves as a member of both their Executive Advisory Committee and current Board of Directors.  Teens With a Purpose is supports underserved teens through poetry, art, leadership, and education in community activism.
